    Determine if a string is a valid channel name.

    The exact text from RFC2812 ยง1.3 is as follows:

    Channels names are strings (beginning with a '&', '#', '+' or '!'
    character) of length up to fifty (50) characters.  Apart from the
    requirement that the first character is either '&', '#', '+' or '!',
    the only restriction on a channel name is that it SHALL NOT contain
    any spaces (' '), a control G (^G or ASCII 7), a comma (',').  Space
    is used as parameter separator and command is used as a list item
    separator by the protocol).  A colon (':') can also be used as a
    delimiter for the channel mask.  Channel names are case insensitive.
